# My Python examples

In this part of my repository, I am maintaining python scripts to accomplish a variety of tasks.  If I'm right, I don't have any personal information here as I rely on local references to "do the right thing" to access my files.  For example, my AWS account credentials are part root folders, not baked into these scripts.

Where possible, I will add comments to my scripts.
