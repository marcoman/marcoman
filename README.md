# marcoman

This sandbox environment is for experimental work.  Where possible, I'll include a readme to help explain what is included.

As a public repository, the information here is provided "as-is."

Also, used as a testbed for experiments.

- Include a repo change to trigger externals.

# TODO

- Add a license.
