This sandbox environment is for experimental work.  In lieu of creating multiple repositories for different experiments, this is a collection mostly organized into different folders.  Where possible, I'll include a readme to help explain what is included.

Many companies and people want to see examples on public repositories.  However, I am not always able to share because a segment of my work is intended to be secret on account of being a customer/prospect example, partnership in development, or other activity that can't readily be posted on the interwebs.

As a public repository, the information here is provided "as-is."
